1
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
The late fourth century A.D. the 
Roman Empire began to crumble.

2
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,700
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt,
still retained some of its lustre,...

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
...possessed one of the Seven 
Wonders of the ancient world:...

4
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,200
...the legendary lighthouse, 
and the biggest library known.

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,800
The library was a not only 
cultural but a religious symbol,...

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
a place where the pagans worshiped 
their ancestral gods.

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,400
The traditional pagan worship 
in the city now coexisted...

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,900
...with the Jews, and an unstoppable 
religion up to now banned,...

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,900
...Christianity.

10
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Library of Alexandria, 391 A.D.

11
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,900
After taking the library, many 
pagans were converted...

12
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,900
Hipatia continued teaching and 
researching,...

13
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,900
...while his former students held...

14
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,900
...important positions in the 
social elite.

15
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,900
The empire was split in two forever.

16
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Many Christians saw this as a 
sign of the end of the world...

17
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
...and decided to prepare by 
practicing a more holy life.

18
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,400
The order of "Parabolanos" monks 
was charged to go...

19
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,900
...through the streets and watch
for Christian morality...

20
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,000
...now uneven by the presence
of the Jews.

21
00:56:55,400 --> 00:01:21,400
The Library, years later.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,000
How many fools
have wondered 

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,700
why not the stars fall
from the sky 

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
<i> But you,
not happy to cease of the wise, </ i>

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,300
<i> You know that the stars
do not move up or down. </ i>

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
only reborn <i>
from east to west, </ i>

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,500
<i> following the most perfect post
ever can see , </ i>

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,300
<i> circle. </ i>

29
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Because the circle <i> reigns 
in heaven, </ i>

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,200
<i> the stars would never have fallen
and never will. </ i>

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,000
But what about here on Earth?

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,900
Here, bodies do fall.

33
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,100
But their movements
are not circular but linear.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,500
Look again.

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,400
Again.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,000
No, leave it.

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,700
So,

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
<i> What mysterious wonder 
do you would think </ i>

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,000
<i> that may lurk beneath the earth
for every single person and animal, </ i>

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,900
<i> and object and all laid exact
on there</ i>

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
What may should be?

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,400
The highness, madame.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,700
No.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,300
Sinesio.

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,900
The weighty.

46
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,000
<i> No, you both speaking about the same thing,
but you not talking about primary course. </ i>

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Has anyone ever thought about
your..

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,700
your feet ...

49
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,000
your feet

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,400
<i> standing perched on the
very center of the cosmos </ i>

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,200
that holds all things together,
pull them together

52
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,200
If there is no center,
the universe would be

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,200
deformed, infinite, formless,

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,700
<i> chaotic. </ i>

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,200
Doesn't matter that we were <i>
here, there or anywhere </ i>

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,600
What you will do? That's right
never being born

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Library of Alexandria 391 AD

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
God, Our Father,

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
lord of the universe,

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
origin of all things,

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,100
eternal force of the cosmos,

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,100
where everything has
its beginning and its end.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,900
Mighty Serapis,
Isis, Horus,

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,600
And all the gods Anubis
that protect us

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,100
both in heaven
and on earth ...

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,700
Something happens in the market.

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,100
I know you also feel something.
I've seen.

68
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,100
Tell the master that we leave.

69
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Can you believe. He was counting me
as the part of their conquests

70
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,200
This Orestes also foolish
as his father.

71
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,200
I have already suggested that you take
his heart to another muse

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,900
one more beautiful than me.

73
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,200
- Who?
The music.

74
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,200
<i> Music </ i>

75
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,500
He find his music.

76
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,000
What happen 227 had become 
16 ?

77
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Divide  with 14.

78
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,900
<i> They behave like humans!
Eat, drink and fornicate! </ I>

79
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,000
If my gods <i> eat, drink
and fornicate, good for them </ i>

80
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,500
Know this,

81
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,700
you who console yourself
with pagan images.

82
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,600
Men, women,
birds, reptiles!

83
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Serapis!

84
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,100
Serapis! Who could trust
the God, need a flower pot

85
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,000
for crown?

86
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,300
Hey You, Christians, how arrogant you 
to take another

87
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,800
Empire attitude like this

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,700
My father's father saw them

89
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,800
slaughtered at the circus

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
and ate to the lions.

91
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Enough! Watch.

92
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
Watch.

93
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,800
You see now 
I walk cross the fire.

94
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,300
If my god ...

95
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,400
If my God is the true god,
I unscathed, no hurt.

96
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
And if your gods exist,

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
<i> they'll roast me like a pig. </ i>

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,100
You ...

99
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,300
You're lie!

100
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,900
You'll burn!

101
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,200
You will have what you deserve!

102
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,400
Let's see if you can walk cross
the fire.

103
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,200
What are you doing?

104
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
<i> Stop, you can not do that!
Leave him alone. </ I>

105
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,500
<i> Quiet! or you will follow. </ i>

106
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,300
Who is this?

107
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,500
Who is this?

108
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,000
How many times should I
must repeat message?

109
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Today,

110
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,800
Christians
burn a man.

111
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Right in the middle of agora!

112
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,200
I will not have this in my house!

113
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,700
Not in the house of Theon!

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,300
Give it to me.

115
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,400
Give it to me!

116
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,900
No terrific mercy is way go

117
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
- Davo!
Get up.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
You have nothing to do
with this.

119
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,700
I do, i am a Christian.

120
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,200
<i> What did you say? </ i>

121
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,200
I do. I am a Christian
Punish both of us.

122
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,800
So, now we'll presume to teach
us a mercy

123
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Get a whip.
- Father!

124
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,300
Calm ...

125
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,300
Father, I beg you.
I begged you

126
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
wrapped in.. in blazing, right?

127
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,400
To the flames, stupid.

128
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,800
<i> Why did not you burned like the heathen?
Tell me. </ I>

129
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,600
Leave us ...

130
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,800
Come here.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,300
Kneel.

132
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,700
<i> Tell me, is true
you are a Christian? </ i>

133
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,900
I do not know what to say, madame.
- Why not?

134
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,400
If i say yes, that will be a lie

135
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,300
If I said no, i lied to
my master and I do not know which is worse.

136
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,300
Then say nothing.

137
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,800
That's it.

138
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,200
Thank you.

139
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,400
<i> The master is very angry
himself. </ i>

140
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,000
What is that?

141
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,900
Something I've done.

Yes it is.

146

Have you done?

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Earth

148
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,300
is the center of the cosmos

149
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,700
and revolve around

150
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,500
the sun

151
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,200
and the five wanderers: Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

152
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,800
Never disobeying
the law of the circle.Never

153
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,400
Ptolemy
told me show as do obey.

154
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800

<i> in a loop </ i>

159
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,200
and the smaller circle

<i> own each wandering. </ i>

161
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,900
Loop, the epicycles
"say you see is not happen on the earth"

162
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,600
but our eyes
deceive us.

163
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,700
Well search, Davo.

164
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I like you do the explanation search even 
paying course attention or not

165
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,600
One or two..up here

166
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,800
I tell you The Gods should consulted
to me before they creating anything.

167
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,900
Why say that?

168
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
<i> It's all so whimsical! </ i>

169
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,300
Why is the joint take of
two circles?

170
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,000
Would not be more, perfect
if the wander is..

171
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
if wander and a single circle
give sense to everything?

172
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
What authority do you judge
the work of God?

173
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,700
What is wrong with you, Christians?

174
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,100
The man is no longer with brief mouth
in this city

175
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,800
Could you decide creation, you could decide
a Lord, 

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,300
and you offended.
You should move to the desert.

177
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,300
You will not hear anything offensive there.

178
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,800
You know nothing about you speak.

Hypatia and her students
follow in the atrium.

577

Are they crazy?

578
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,300

Go.

617
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,800
Go.

618
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,800
From now on, in Alexandria

619
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,500
only permitted ceremonies
Christian and Jewish.

620
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,100
<i> pagan sacrifices, </ i>

621
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,300
the worship of pagan symbols

622
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,800
and visits to pagan temples
are prohibited.

623
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:00,300
<i> If someone makes such acts
or even look at the statues </ i>

624
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,800
<i> of their ancient gods,

625
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,900
Damn Jews!

626
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,300
Damn Jews!

627
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,100
They're just a bunch of thugs,
a bunch of animals.

628
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,900
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

629
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,600
Let Bishop Cyril
begun his own depend.

630
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,300
Prefect

631
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,200
our blessed parabolans,

632
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,100
Hung hi has just called

633
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,200
<i> me..? the bird, </ i>

634
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,500
default them self ..
strong enough to carry loads

635
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,500
repel, six,
levers ...

636
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,900
And stones!

637
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,700
Prefect can carry stones.

638
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,300
I know they was enter the theater

639
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,400
and stoned knowing we'll do nothing
to defend

640
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,800
Non sense. Because it is the Sabbath!

641
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,200
On the Sabbath you should
honor God

642
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,000
in your synagogues
instead stopping yourself

643
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,700
set in theater.

644
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,200
Therefore I showered stones.

645
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,100
<i> Prefect, you hear that?
Now he threatened us. It is too much..</ i>

646
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,400
Friends, there are more things that unite
us than divide us.

647
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,600
We are brothers!
We are all brothers

648
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,700
Where would you Christians be

649
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,900
without the Jews?
Jesus was a Jew!

650
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,300
Jesus was Jewish!

651
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,200
There is .a .something I find

652
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,200
stubbing what You've told.

653
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
- What?
Well,

654
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,100
Why Cyril begin
to cleaning up the city?

655
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,400
is he not satisfied
with what they already have?

656
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,600
He just wants to scare the Jews.

657
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,500
but why you say then before..

658
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,800
What if really interesting.. you
and not them?

659
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,600
Me?

660
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,400
Why?
I'm as Christian as he.

661
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,500
Yes, but forget

662
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,500
that many of your friends
that circle are not.

663
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,500
A full sail, prefect.

664
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500
Lets go.

665
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,800
-Aspasius, you ready?
Yes, mistress.

666
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,900
I would like you to take the sack
and flying to top the mast.

667
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,800
And now, Lady,

668
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,700
Will you finally tell me what 
the point?

669
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,100
When Aspasius

670
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,100
drop the sack, the boat
will be moving forward.

671
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,600
Therefore, the sack

672
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,400
not fall at the foot of the mast,

673
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,600
but will fall further back.
About ...

674
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,600
here.

675
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,800
And what's so special about that?

676
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,800
- Yes!
- But You're wrong!

677
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yes, but this is definitely 
proved

678
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,700
<i> definitive. The sack </ i>

679
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,600
has behaved as if
the boat stationary.

680
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,400
<i> What does that mean? </ i>

681
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,400
 i do not know.

682
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,700
But the same principle can 
be applied to the Earth.

683
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,500
we could be moving around the sun
without our knowledge.

684
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,400
<i>-Aristarchus.
Exactly. </ I>

685
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,000
Why are you troubled yourself
by that, Lady?

686
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,700
Ptolemy <i> not perfect, </ i>

687
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,400
but it works.

688
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,600
Orestes, as this with you warrior ...

689
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,800
A few years ago you was not
so pragmatic, prefect.

690
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,600
A few years ago i spoke first
before thinking.

691
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,300
I have Cepheus <i> third. </ i>

692

48.

694
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,700
Venus and Mars

695
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,500
share house in Aquarius.

696
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,600
My father would have celebrated
something like a good wine.

697
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,400
The stars will not fall.
- Really?

698
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,200
<i> No, because they are subject

What chance for you talking about?

701
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,100
Do not you know that the universe
is a huge chest, don't you?

702
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,500
They laid on top
and the Earth ground.

703
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,700
In this idiot not been told
that the Earth is round!

704
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,500
The Earth is flat.

705
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,700
Your head is really flat.

706
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,400
Read the Scriptures!

707
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,600
If the earth is round,

708
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,600
Why not the people that live 
in the bottom, fall out?

709
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,800
What about the one sides?

710
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,900
Why not slip?

711
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,200
Think about it.

712
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,200
Davo knows.

713
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,700
hi Brother.

714
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,100
What do you say?

715
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,100
Does the earth is flat or round?

716
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,200
Only God knows these things.

717
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,800
Leave them in the ground!

718
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,600

719
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,500
Lady, do not despair.

720
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Today in the boat you make
great progress.

721
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:09,000
Why do the wandering very 
that rightness

722
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,400
so unexpected?

723
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,500
And what is worse,

724
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,600
Why does the sun?

725
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,600
Why is change size
summer to winter?

726
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,500
Perhaps it's because

01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,800
and sometimes farther?

729
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,200
But Aspasia

730
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,400
watch.

731
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,500
According Aristarchus, the sun must be

732
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,200
in the center of everything.

733
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,300
With us, the Earth,

734
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,400
traveling in a circle around him.

735
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,500
Therefore,

736
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,400
and this is the key

737
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,800
We are always exactly

738
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,500
same ...

739
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,400
distance.

740
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,700
If, as you say,
accept that changes the distance,

741
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,600
that forces us to add

742
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,800
epicycle into orbit
Earth.

743
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,800
<i> To be closer
and then farther away. </ i>

744
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,300
Now then we fall
in the same trap as Ptolemy.

745
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,100
<i>-circles upon circles.
- Exactly! </ I>

746
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,600
I do not know how to solve
this conflict.

747
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,800
<i> let me know we can do it </ i>

748
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,300

01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,500

750
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,600
My heart, Aspasia.

751
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,700
So,

752
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,200
What do we do?

753
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,000
Resting, lady.

754
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,200
Parabolans!

755
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,900

It is a fire.

Come on!

01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,700
Gather water! The cube!
Take it!

01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,400

Come, come!

Parabolans, quick!

767
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,500
Where's the fire?

768
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,500
Where's the fire?

769
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,100
Jews! It's a trap.

770
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,700
It's a trap!

771
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,700
Christians all

772
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,100
last night is one night was deplorable.

773
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,400
Now I say to you .

774
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,200
Grave no longer
for our dead brothers.

775
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,700
weep not.

776
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,400
Said you killed for the others,

777
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,300
but they are executioners.

778
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,700
Yes, yes.

779
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,700
Weep for them.
Then they

780
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,000
they know neither God,

781
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,500
neither love nor holiness.

782
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,700
I do not know.

783
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,600
because in this day

784
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,100
who repeated the Scriptures
without understanding at all.

785
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,500
It is they who saw
only a man

786
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,400
when the Son of God
standing on the front of us.

787
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,200
And it is they who

Lady, do not stop, Lady.

801
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,700
Now whole the Jews
want revenge!

802
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,100
I'm afraid you do not understand
what is really happening.

803
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:27,200
<i> When this is over,

Where are the troops?

807
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,200
Why do not more soldiers
on the streets?

808
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,500
No army can contain
entire city.

821
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I see.

822
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,800
But if you do nothing now,

823
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,100
I believe that Cyril

824
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:39,700
will continue do the same thing
over and over again

825
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:45,000
until no people
for this government to govern.

826
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,400
How naive with me.

827
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,200

01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,900
The Bishop of Cyrene.

832
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,900
- What is he doing here?
I'll find out

833
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,800
It's my little library
of Alexandria.

834
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,200
This is where I teach children.

835
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,300

Orestes and should be here
by now.

The parabole

It's beautiful.

843
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,000
Often I look and wonder

844
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,000

Forgive me.

851
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,300
Two Christians in the hands
of a pagan.

852
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,900

I can not forgive.

01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,400
Who?

Jews?

869
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,300
Jesus forgave on the cross.

870
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,600
Jesus was God

871
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,800
and only he can show
such leniency.

872
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,200

Why?

876
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,400
Because it was

on the stones.

878
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,500
God wants us here,
doing what we do.

879
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,100
To believe in that belief?

before I accept your faith? </ i>

913
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,400
Why, then,

914
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,500
should this assembly

915
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,400
accept the consult of
someone who ability dilution

916
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,600
absolutely nothing?

917
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,500
I believe in philosophy.

918
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,800
Philosophy.

919
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,200
Just what we need

920
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,100
in such times.

921
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,400
Enough!

922
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,200
I've been studying

923
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,400
absolutely no life.
for my own

924
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,800
And I wonder

925
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,600
wow.
- Forget about what i said today.

926
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,700
Is all
life holds for me?

927
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,100
What else?

928
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,600
I doubt anyone can see 

929
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,200
as devoted wife

930
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,400
and mother.

931
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,300
I think ...

932
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:54,800
I think the whole city
know the history of the handkerchief.

933
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,500
So ...

934
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,800
My father loved that one.

935
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,700
Even <i> he ...</ i>

936
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,300
Who have the loved?

937
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,100
Except you,

938
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,400
Lebanon.

939
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,100
If only I could ...

940
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,400
fathom this ...

941
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,000
a little more.

942
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:45,000

Why?

946
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,300
Why that's mean so much to you?

947
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,400
Right now,

948
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,300
this every second,
whole earth could be moving

949
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,500
and no one realized it.

950
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,100
<i> Except you and me </ i>

951
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,500
Believe me Lady, it's best
that nobody notices.

952
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,200
Really not it important?

953
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,800
i Do not understand why you insist
moving the ground they walk on.

954
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,100
Dress yourself
what happened on the boat.

955
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:26,100
Yes i dit,But that does not mean
this sailing on the earth moves.

956
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,400
<i> What if it does </ i>

957
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Hypatia, look around.

958
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,500
Death,

959
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:33,900
horror

960
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,400
destruction.

961
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,200
<i> If the stars move in
the Circle, </ i>

963
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,500
So we are not moving.

964

In circle.

965
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,800
We do not move ...

<i> circle. </ i>

967
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,100
We move in circles.

968
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,400
Since Plato,

969
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,200
all of them: Aristarchus
Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

970
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:15,100
all have tried
reconcile their observations

971
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,100
<i> with circular orbits. </ i>

972
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,600
<i> but What happen

973
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,500
Another way?

974
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,700
Lady, There is no purer than the
circle, you yourself have taught us.

975
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,800
I know, but suppose

976
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,100
that the purity

977
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:32,900
the circle
prevented us from seeing beyond.

978
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,100
Just like the sunshine
prevents us from seeing

979
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,800
stars.

980
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,900
I must begin again

981
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,400
with new eyes.

982
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,100
I have to rethink everything.

983
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,600
All.

984
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,600
Reading the first letter
Paul to Timothy.

985
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,600
I therefore wish
that everywhere

986
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,200
men would lift their prayers

987
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,800
without anger or disputes.

988
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,400
Equally,

989
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,000
that women desire

990
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,500
dress modestly,

991
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,400
decency and propriety

992
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,000
without braids in her hair

993
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,100
or gold or pearls

994
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,100
or expensive clothes,

995
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,500
-but with good deeds.''
- Why read this passage?

996
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:41,300
I do not know, I promise
which is not agreed.

997
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,300
Let the woman learn

998
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,700
<i> quiet and full submission,
i can't allow a woman </ i>

999
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:51,200
to teach or have authority

1000
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,200
but to be

1001
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,400
silent

1002
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,700

Amen.

1005
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,200
Jesus himself

1006
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,800
knew this when

1007
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,100

Nothing woman among them.

01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,900
And yet,

The philosopher Hypatia.

A woman who declare,

01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:41,500

1017
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:46,800

Listen!

1136
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,400
Why did can not we do more
easy and effective?

1137
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,800
What do you talking about?

1138
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,800
We can hurts........

That a whore.
- Who?

<i> What if we dared

1143
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,000
What shape would it show us?
what shape

1144
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:08,600
You said once the problem
is the inconsistency of the sun.

1145
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,600
Yes I did, good..good
Put it into words.

1146
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:16,200
The sun must be at the center
as we turned around.

1147
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:17,600
And at the same time

1148
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,100
in another position seen the
distance from it varies.

1149
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,000
Yes, exactly.
- How?

1150
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,000
How could occupy
two position?

1151
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,100
How can occupy
two position at once?

1152
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,300
How can occupy
two position ?

1153
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,100
Aspasius ...

1154
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,900
Yes, yes. There.
And the other one here.

1155
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,000
Maintaining the same proportion.

1156
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,900
Okay.
Tie this end there.

1157
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,000
Aspasia

1158
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,800
imagines that this is Earth

1159
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:39,200
<i> and the each of flames represent the two
extreme positions of the sun relation to it: </ i>

1160
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,900
in winter and summer.

1161
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:45,700
<i> What happen if both positions
were the two centers </ i>

1162
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,500
<i> of the same circle </ i>

1163
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,100
That is impossible, mistress.

1164
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,900
wait what we know about the circle?
We know that center of the circles

1165
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,700
<i> is always same distance to any point
its perimeter. </ i>

1166
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:56,900
<i> Exactly.
Yes. </ I>

1167
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,600
What if the center divided into two

1168
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:03,800
<i> but keep constant the sum
distances to its perimeter </ i>

1169
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:09,200
Okay, I'll show you what.
As I move this rod along

1170
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,500
the rope,
a segment increases

1171
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,800
and the other decreases.
And vice versa.

1172
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:16,900
Thus the sum of the two always..

1173
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,000
constant. You see that?

1174
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,600
We apply this, to the movement

1175
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,900
Earth?

1176
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,600
What ...

1177
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:44,900
will be ...

1178
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,300
obtained ?

1179
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:52,100
An ellipse!

1180
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:56,300
<i> An ellipse with the sun
in one focus. </ i>

1181
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,300
Because,

1182
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,600
<i> what is the circle but </ i>

1183
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,700

1184
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:07,400

i mean That is, what is this?
Maybe i just .. ..

1187
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:19,700
Perhaps you ...

1188
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,000
What do you think?

1189
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,600
This could be solved, mistress.

1190
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,900
Well done, we will
with this tomorrow.

1191
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,000
Get some sleep.

1192
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,500
Good night, mistress.
Good night.

1193
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,800
Thank you.

Where is everybody?

1201
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,100
Please sit down.

1202

Christian faith
